### 🗒️ Summary

Our project is an AI-powered tool designed to help users organize and prioritize their daily tasks efficiently. The system uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand task descriptions and applies intelligent algorithms to schedule them based on urgency, importance, and deadlines. It aims to reduce stress, improve time management, and increase productivity by offering personalized task suggestions and automatic reminders.

### 🎯 Background

Modern teams often face challenges in managing multiple tasks, deadlines, and communications across different platforms. Traditional task managers require manual input and lack smart prioritization. Our motivation is to design an AI system that automatically understands tasks, assigns deadlines, and suggests priorities, reducing human effort. This topic is important because effective work management directly improves team efficiency, lowers stress, and ensures projects meet deadlines.

### 🚀 Plan

Requirement Analysis – Define key features (task extraction, scheduling, reminders, reporting).

Data Collection – Gather datasets of task descriptions, schedules, and productivity patterns.

Modeling – Apply NLP to extract tasks from text (emails, chat, notes) and use ML models for priority prediction and scheduling.

System Design – Build frontend (dashboard/web app) and backend (task storage, API, AI engine).

Evaluation – Test accuracy of task extraction and scheduling suggestions with real users.

Demo & Deployment – Create an interactive demo showcasing automated task management, reminders, and analytics.
